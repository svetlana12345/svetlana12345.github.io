	      <p>
	        There is no doubt that homemade ice-cream is the best, because you can tailor it to your own tastes. 
	        When I was a kid, one of our family friends would make homemade ice-cream for our birthdays with a 
	        hand-cranked ice-cream maker. We all thought it was fun to have a turn at the crank, but it got tiring 
	        fast. Now there's electric ice-cream makers, so there's no need for hand-cranking to make your own.

	      <h3>Izzy's Ice-Cream</h3>
	      <p>
	        <a href="https://izzysicecream.com/">Izzy's Ice-Cream</a> located on Marshal Avenue in St. Paul and 
	        2nd Street in Minneapolis, Izzy's is hands-down my favorite Twin Cities ice-cream. They have over 150 
	        flavors which rotate in and out through out the year, many using local and seasonal ingredients. Deciding 
	        on a favorite flavor is tough, but fortunately you get a sampler Izzy scoop with your order, so you can 
	        have two! Some of my favorites are Mexican Chocolate, Dark Chocolate Zin, Norwegian Chai, Salted Caramel 
	        &amp; Sugar Cookie.
