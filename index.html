    Description Mastering Ansible is a step-by-step journey of learning Ansible for configuration management and orchestration. The course is designed as a journey through configuring a realistic application stack from the ground up. Instead of going page-by-page through the Ansible documentation, topics are ordered to align with the growing complexity of our application as we build it up and refactor it. In addition to the core concepts of configuration with Ansible, we spend time on building tools to help us maintain and troubleshoot our application. The goal is to have a workflow where all of the configuration and troubleshooting is done through ansible playbooks that can be committed to a repository and improved over time. The course is divided into 6 sections, starting with initial installation and foundational concepts. Starting in section 3, we build up a sample application environment layer-by-layer, learning a new concept in each lecture. After the application is up and running, we refactor our setup in section 4 with an emphasis on modularity and encapsulation. In section 5, we optimize our code and learn about techniques to reduce the playbook execution time. The course finishes with a final section on troubleshooting and testing. For each lecture, we introduce a new Ansible concept and apply it to our playbooks. For most lectures, we execute the new concept in the demo environment so you can see what the output should look like. In the notes of each lecture, you'll find a link to the relevant documentation pages, along with a snapshot of the codebase at the end of that lecture. This course was built with Ansible version 1.9.3, applied to a 3-tiered web application environment leveraging NGINX, Apache2, Python, and MySQL on Ubuntu Linux servers. We do not cover administering Windows servers in this course. This course is designed as an introduction to Ansible, but also as a guide for engineers interested in configuration management, orchestration, infrastructure-as-code, and devops principles. Who is the target audience? The course is designed for students who have little or no experience with Ansible, but are familiar with Linux systems administration concepts. No programming or previous automation experience is required. If you've never logged into a Linux shell and run commands before, you will learn the Ansible syntax but you may not understand the 'why' behind the tasks that we configure. We try to explain all systems concept that we cover, but we aren't starting from the beginning with Linux in this course. Learning Puppet at your own pace The Puppet Learning VM is an interactive tutorial and learning environment to get you started with Puppet or level up the skills you already have. Explore the technology in depth with a series of detailed multi-step quests. Working through the Puppet Enterprise console GUI and Linux command-line, you'll learn the building block concepts of Puppet such as resources, manifests, classes and modules, then move on to more advanced topics including defined resource types and application orchestration. Ready to get started? Complete the registration form to download the Learning VM. Download the zip file containing the Learning VM open virtualization archive (OVA) and setup instructions. Follow the steps in the instructions to import the Learning VM OVA into your virtualization software and get started with the Quest Guide. Minimum requirements Internet-enabled Windows, OS X, or Linux computer with 10GB free space and a VT-x/AMD-V enabled processor. 4GB free memory (8GB is recommended) 2 Core 2.5 Ghz (or better) CPU with 64-bit architecture Up-to-date VirtualBox or VMware desktop virtualization software
